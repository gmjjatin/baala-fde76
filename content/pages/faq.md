      frequently asked questions for e-commerce customers.

    questions:
      - question: How long does shipping take?
        answer: >
          Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this
          should *manage customer expectations*. Just like [a good checkout
          flow](http://bit.ly/2YCN3iG) should. Tell them the truth:


          *   India shipping will take between 3 to 5 business days.

          *   International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.

          *   Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s
          Twitter account.
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of incense sticks will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:


          *   All discounted items sales are final.

          *   If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return
          label. Instructions are printed on its back.

          *   If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at
          hello.baala@gmail.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS
          and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).
