      - title: We love incense sticks
        description: >
          Now THAT is true, but we love creating incense sticks in an
          environment-friendly way even more. We talk about it on our blog,
          like, [a lot](http://bit.ly/2YA6999). We often craft live demos of how
          the incense sticks are made from temple flowers. We believe in "What
          comes from temples goes back to them".
